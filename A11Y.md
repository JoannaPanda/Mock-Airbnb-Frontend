Attempts:

1. Alternative Text for Images:
The presence of the alt attribute in the img elements ensures that screen readers can convey meaningful information about images to users who may have visual impairments.

2. Focus Indicators:
We ensure that interactive elements have visible focus indicators. This is crucial for users who navigate using a keyboard or other assistive technologies. The IconButton and other clickable elements also provide a clear visual indication of focus.

3. Contrast Ratio:
We consider the contrast ratio between text and background colors to ensure readability, especially for users with low vision or color blindness. This aligns with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) for color contrast.

4. Responsive Design:
The use of ResponsiveContainer shows consideration for users accessing the application on different devices and screen sizes. Responsive design is a key factor in making content accessible to a diverse audience.

5. Error Handling and Notifications:
Our error handling includes user-friendly notifications, it contributes to a more accessible experience. Ensure that error messages are conveyed clearly and that users are provided with guidance on how to resolve issues.

6. Form Accessibility:
We have proper labeling of form elements and provide additional context or instructions. This assists users in understanding the purpose and requirements of each form field.

7. Consistent Navigation Structure:
Consistency in the navigation structure across different pages contributes to a more predictable and accessible user experience (e.g. PublishedListing and HostedListing). We ensure that navigation menus and page structures are logically organized.
